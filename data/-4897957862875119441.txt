This research investigates the potential of augmented reality (AR) to enhance enjoyment
and education for Generation Z visitors at the Uffizi Gallery. Through interviews with
Generation Z members, the study explores their perceptions and experiences with AR
technology in art museums. Utilizing an interactive visual aid, participants are introduced
to five AR categories, each illustrating different aspects within a museum setting. The
findings offer valuable insights for museums and cultural heritage sites seeking to
engage and attract Generation Z visitors effectively.
