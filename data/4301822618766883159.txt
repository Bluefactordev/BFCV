ABOUT ME
I like observing and listening to nature, which is why I have always found a moment in my week to 'escape' from the hectic city life to a mountain or the sea. I grew up in a family with various cultures (Italian/Spanish/American) and because of this I have felt like a citizen of the world since I was a child. I love to travel, to fill my eyes, my mind and my soul with the colors that every people, culture, nature can offer; in fact, my right hemisphere is on a plane travelling to unknown worlds and my left hemisphere is on earth trying to bring my experiences into everyday life.

HOBBIES
July 2011 - Present

I have obtained the following patents: TSSA (Medical Transport and Rescue in Ambulance 118), FullD (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation with semiautomatic defibrillator adult, child, infant), Pediatric and Adult Disostriction Maneuvers (Heimlich Maneuver), Infectious Disease update (health worker 118 COVID). Various experiences with foreign delegations as a translator and cultural mediator.
