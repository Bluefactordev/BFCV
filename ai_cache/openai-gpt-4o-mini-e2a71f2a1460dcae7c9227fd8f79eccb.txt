I’m motivated by learning, by insight, and by the chance to build something meaningful. With a background in International Relations and a Master’s in Fashion & Luxury Management, I’ve learned to merge strategic reasoning with intuitive understanding, balancing structure with creativity. I’m drawn to dynamic, thoughtful environments where growth is tangible, collaboration is authentic, and excellence is guided by purpose rather than pace. I’m looking for a role that allows me to combine analytical thinking with creative intuition, where I can learn continuously and contribute with dedication, awareness, and authenticity. Open to new opportunities and cultural contexts, I’m ready to take on experiences that challenge me, expand my vision, and allow me to keep evolving, both personally and professionally. The sun, the sea, cookies, the mood of a place, attention to small details, personal care, perfumes, and all the little things I adore, always find their way in. Endlessly curious and fascinated by the world in all its forms, I find joy in balancing creativity with discipline, bringing a sense of care and intention to everything I do. New recipes, long walks, a couple of episodes of my current series, and the organization of my surroundings with attention, scent, and atmosphere are part of my everyday life.  \n\n---\n\n**Privacy Statement**  \nI hereby authorize the processing of my personal data included in this CV in accordance with the Italian Legislative Decree no. 196/2003 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) no. 2016/679, for the purposes of recruitment and selection."
